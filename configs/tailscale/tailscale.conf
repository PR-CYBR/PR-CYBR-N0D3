# Tailscale Configuration for PR-CYBR-N0D3
#
# This configuration template defines Tailscale mesh network settings
# Replace placeholders with actual values from your Tailscale admin console

# Authentication key (generate from Tailscale admin console)
# Use ephemeral keys for testing, reusable keys for production
authkey: "tskey-auth-your-key-here"

# Accept subnet routes advertised by other nodes
accept_routes: true

# Accept DNS configuration from Tailscale
accept_dns: true

# Hostname for this node in Tailscale network
# Will be registered as: hostname.tailnet-name.ts.net
hostname: "pr-cybr-n0d3-{{ node_id }}"

# Advertise routes (subnets this node can route to)
# Example: advertise_routes: ["10.0.0.0/24", "192.168.1.0/24"]
advertise_routes: []

# Enable Tailscale SSH (remote access without SSH keys)
enable_ssh: false

# Accept risk of using Tailscale for outbound traffic
# (Use this node as exit node)
advertise_exit_node: false

# Run Tailscale in userspace networking mode
# Useful for containers or limited permission environments
userspace_networking: false

# Configuration notes:
# 1. Generate auth keys at: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
# 2. Use reusable, non-expiring keys for production nodes
# 3. Tag nodes appropriately in Tailscale admin for ACL management
# 4. Consider MagicDNS for easy hostname resolution
# 5. Set up ACLs to control traffic between nodes

# Example ACL policy in Tailscale admin:
# {
#   "groups": {
#     "group:pr-cybr-nodes": ["tag:pr-cybr-n0d3"],
#   },
#   "acls": [
#     {
#       "action": "accept",
#       "src": ["group:pr-cybr-nodes"],
#       "dst": ["group:pr-cybr-nodes:*"]
#     }
#   ]
# }

# Tailscale tags for this node (set via Tailscale admin or CLI)
# Tags: pr-cybr-n0d3, client-node, production
